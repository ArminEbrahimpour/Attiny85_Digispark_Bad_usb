There is some codes for Attiny85 board for making bad usb( mention that all these are for educational purposes and I do not accept any bad usage from these codes)
All you need to do is to install Arduino IDE and installing Arduino Drive from github if you are using windows and add these programs with IDE and enjoy it 
metion that these codes works only on windows 

Have fun!
